1    That man hath perfect blessedness,
          who walketh not astray
     In counsel of ungodly men,
          nor stands in sinners' way,

     Nor sitteth in the scorner's chair:
2          But placeth his delight
     Upon God's law, and meditates
          on his law day and night.

3    He shall be like a tree that grows
          near planted by a river,
     Which in his season yields his fruit,
          and his leaf fadeth never:

     And all he doth shall prosper well
4        The wicked are not so;
     But like they are unto the chaff,
          which wind drives to and fro.

5    In judgment therefore shall not stand
          such as ungodly are;
     Nor in th' assembly of the just
          shall wicked men appear.

6    For why? the way of godly men
          unto the Lord is known:
     Whereas the way of wicked men
          shall quite be overthrown.
