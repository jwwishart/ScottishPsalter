1    Lord, thee I'll praise with all my heart,
          thy wonders all proclaim.
2    In thee, most High, I'll greatly joy,
          and sing unto thy name.

3    When back my foes were turn'd, they fell,
          and perish'd at thy sight:
4    For thou maintain'dst my right and cause;
          on throne sat'st judging right.

5    The heathen thou rebuked hast,
          the wicked overthrown;
     Thou hast put out their names, that they
          may never more be known.

6    O en'my! now destructions have
          an end perpetual:
     Thou cities raz'd; perish'd with them
          is their memorial.

7    God shall endure for aye; he doth
          for judgment set his throne;
8    In righteousness to judge the world,
          justice to give each one.

9    God also will a refuge be
          for those that are oppress'd;
     A refuge will he be in times
          of trouble to distress'd.

10   And they that know thy name, in thee
          their confidence will place:
     For thou hast not forsaken them
          that truly seek thy face.

11   O sing ye praises to the Lord,
          that dwells in Sion hill;
     And all the nations among
          his deeds record ye still.

12   When he enquireth after blood,
          he then rememb'reth them:
     The humble folk he not forgets
          that call upon his name.

13   Lord, pity me; behold the grief
          which I from foes sustain;
     Ev'n thou, who from the gates of death
          dost raise me up again;

14  That I, in Sion's daughters' gates,
          may all thy praise advance;
     And that I may rejoice always
          in thy deliverance.

15  The heathen are sunk in the pit
          which they themselves prepar'd;
     And in the net which they have hid
          their own feet fast are snar'd.

16  The Lord is by the judgment known
          which he himself hath wrought:
     The sinners' hands do make the snares
          wherewith themselves are caught.

17  They who are wicked into hell
          each one shall turned be;
     And all the nations that forget
          to seek the Lord most high.

18 For they that needy are shall not
          forgotten be alway;
     The expectation of the poor
          shall not be lost for aye.

19 Arise, Lord, let not man prevail;
          judge heathen in thy sight:
20   That they may know themselves but men,
          the nations, Lord, affright.
