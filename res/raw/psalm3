1     O Lord, how are my foes increas'd?
          against me many rise.
2     Many say of my soul, For him
          in God no succour lies.

3     Yet thou my shield and glory art,
          th' uplifter of mine head.
4     I cry'd, and, from his holy hill,
          the Lord me answer made.

5     I laid me down and slept; I wak'd;
          for God sustained me.
6     I will not fear though thousands ten
          set round against me be.

7     Arise, O Lord; save me, my God;
          for thou my foes hast stroke
      All on the cheek-bone, and the teeth
          of wicked men hast broke.

8     Salvation doth appertain
          unto the Lord alone:
      Thy blessing, Lord, for evermore
          thy people is upon.
