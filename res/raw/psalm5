1    Give ear unto my words, O Lord,
          my meditation weigh.
2    Hear my loud cry, my King, my God;
          for I to thee will pray.

3    Lord, thou shalt early hear my voice:
          I early will direct
     My pray'r to thee; and, looking up,
          an answer will expect.

4    For thou art not a God that doth
          in wickedness delight;
     Neither shall evil dwell with thee,
5         Nor fools stand in thy sight.

     All that ill-doers are thou hat'st;
6         Cutt'st off that liars be:
     The bloody and deceitful man
          abhorred is by thee.

7    But I into thy house will come
          in thine abundant grace;
     And I will worship in thy fear
          toward thy holy place.

8    Because of those mine enemies,
          Lord, in thy righteousness
     Do thou me lead; do thou thy way
          make straight before my face.

9    For in their mouth there is no truth,
          their inward part is ill;
     Their throat's an open sepulchre,
          their tongue doth flatter still.

10   O God, destroy them; let them be
          by their own counsel quell'd:
     Them for their many sins cast out,
          for they 'gainst thee rebell'd.

11   But let all joy that trust in thee,
          and still make shouting noise;
     For them thou sav'st; let all that love
          thy name in thee rejoice.
12   For, Lord, unto the righteous man
          thou wilt thy blessing yield:
     With favour thou wilt compass him
          about, as with a shield.
