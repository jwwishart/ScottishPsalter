1    O Lord my God, in thee do I
          my confidence repose:
     Save and deliver me from all
          my persecuting foes;

2    Lest that the enemy my soul
          should, like a lion, tear,
     In pieces rending it, while there
          is no deliverer.

3    O Lord my God, if it be so
          that I committed this;
     If it be so that in my hands
          iniquity there is:

4    If I rewarded ill to him
          that was at peace with me;
     (Yea, ev'n the man that without cause
          my foe was I did free;)

5    Then let the foe pursue and take
          my soul, and my life thrust
     Down to the earth, and let him lay
          mine honour in the dust.

6    Rise in thy wrath, Lord, raise thyself,
          for my foes raging be;
     And, to the judgment which thou hast
          commanded, wake for me.

7    So shall th' assembly of thy folk
          about encompass thee:
     Thou, therefore, for their sakes, return
          unto thy place on high.

8    The Lord he shall the people judge:
          my judge, Jehovah, be,
     After my righteousness, and mine
          integrity in me.

9    O let the wicked's malice end;
          but stablish stedfastly
     The righteous: for the righteous God
          the hearts and reins doth try.

10   In God, who saves th' upright in heart,
          is my defence and stay.
11   God just men judgeth, God is wroth
          with ill men ev'ry day.

12   If he do not return again,
          then he his sword will whet;
     His bow he hath already bent,
          and hath it ready set:

13   He also hath for him prepar'd
          the instruments of death;
     Against the persecutors he
          his shafts ordained hath.

14   Behold, he with iniquity
          doth travail, as in birth;
     A mischief he conceived hath,
          and falsehood shall bring forth.

15   He made a pit and digg'd it deep,
          another there to take;
     But he is fall'n into the ditch
          which he himself did make.

16   Upon his own head his mischief
          shall be returned home;
     His vi'lent dealing also down
          on his own pate shall come.

17   According to his righteousness
          the Lord I'll magnify;
     And will sing praise unto the name
          of God that is most high.
