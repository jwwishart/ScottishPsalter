First Version (Long Metre)

1    Lord, in thy wrath rebuke me not;
          Nor in thy hot rage chasten me.
2    Lord, pity me, for I am weak:
          Heal me, for my bones vexed be.

3    My soul is also vexed sore;
          But, Lord, how long stay wilt thou make?
4    Return, O Lord, my soul set free;
          O save me, for thy mercies' sake.

5    Because those that deceased are
          Of thee shall no remembrance have;
     And who is he that will to thee
          Give praises lying in the grave?

6    I with my groaning weary am,
          I also all the night my bed
     Have caused for to swim; and I
          With tears my couch have watered.

7    Mine eye, consum'd with grief, grows old,
          Because of all mine enemies.
8    Hence from me, wicked workers all;
          For God hath heard my weeping cries.

9    God hath my supplication heard,
          My pray'r received graciously
10   Sham'd and sore vex'd be all my foes,
          Sham'd and back turned suddenly.

Second Version (C.M.)

1    In thy great indignation,
          O Lord, rebuke me not;
     Nor on me lay thy chast 'ning hand,
          in thy displeasure hot.

2    Lord, I am weak, therefore on me
          have mercy, and me spare:
     Heal me, O Lord, because thou know'st
          my bones much vexed are.

3    My soul is vexed sore: but, Lord,
          how long stay wilt thou make?
4    Return, Lord, free my soul; and save
          me, for thy mercies' sake.

5    Because of thee in death there shall
          no more remembrance be:
     Of those that in the grave do lie,
          who shall give thanks to thee?

6    I with my groaning weary am,
          and all the night my bed
     I caused for to swim; with tears
          my couch I watered.

7     By reason of my vexing grief,
          mine eye consumed is;
     It waxeth old, because of all
          that be mine enemies.

8    But now, depart from me all ye
          that work iniquity:
     For why? the Lord hath heard my voice,
          when I did mourn and cry.

9    Unto my supplication
          the Lord did hearing give:
     When I to him my prayer make,
          the Lord will it receive.

10   Let all be sham'd and troubled sore,
          That en'mies are to me;
     Let them turn back, and suddenly
          ashamed let them be.
