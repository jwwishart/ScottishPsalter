1    Give ear unto me when I call,
          God of my righteousness:
     Have mercy, hear my pray'r; thou hast
          enlarg'd me in distress.

2    O ye the sons of men! how long
          will ye love vanities?
     How long my glory turn to shame,
          and will ye follow lies?

3    But know, that for himself the Lord
          the godly man doth chuse:
     The Lord, when I on him do call,
          to hear will not refuse.

4    Fear, and sin not; talk with your heart
          on bed, and silent be.
5    Off 'rings present of righteousness,
          and in the Lord trust ye.

6    O who will shew us any good?
          is that which many say:
     But of thy countenance the light,
          Lord, lift on us alway.

7    Upon my heart, bestow'd by thee,
          more gladness I have found
     Than they, ev'n then, when corn and wine
          did most with them abound.

8    I will both lay me down in peace,
          and quiet sleep will take;
     Because thou only me to dwell
          in safety, Lord, dost make.
