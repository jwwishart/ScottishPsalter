1    Wherefore is it that thou, O Lord,
          dost stand from us afar?
     And wherefore hidest thou thyself,
          when times so troublous are?

2    The wicked in his loftiness
          doth persecute the poor:
     In these devices they have fram'd
          let them be taken sure.

3    The wicked of his heart's desire
          doth talk with boasting great;
     He blesseth him that's covetous,
          whom yet the Lord doth hate.

4    The wicked, through his pride of face,
          on God he doth not call;
     And in the counsels of his heart
          the Lord is not at all.

5    His ways they always grievous are;
          thy judgments from his sight
     Removed are: at all his foes
          he puffeth with despight.

6    Within his heart he thus hath said,
          I shall not moved be;
     And no adversity at all
          shall ever come to me.

7    His mouth with cursing, fraud, deceit,
          is fill'd abundantly;
     And underneath his tongue there is
          mischief and vanity.

8    He closely sits in villages;
          he slays the innocent:
     Against the poor that pass him by
          his cruel eyes are bent.

9    He, lion-like, lurks in his den;
          he waits the poor to take;
     And when he draws him in his net,
          his prey he doth him make.

10   Himself he humbleth very low,
          he croucheth down withal,
     That so a multitude of poor
          may by his strong ones fall.

11   He thus hath said within his heart,
          The Lord hath quite forgot;
     He hides his countenance, and he
          for ever sees it not.

12   O Lord, do thou arise; O God,
          lift up thine hand on high:
     Put not the meek afflicted ones
          out of thy memory.

13   Why is it that the wicked man
          thus doth the Lord despise?
     Because that God will it require
          he in his heart denies.

14   Thou hast it seen; for their mischief
          and spite thou wilt repay:
     The poor commits himself to thee;
          thou art the orphan's stay.

15   The arm break of the wicked man,
          and of the evil one;
     Do thou seek out his wickedness,
          until thou findest none.

16   The Lord is King through ages all,
          ev'n to eternity;
     The heathen people from his land
          are perish'd utterly.

17   O Lord, of those that humble are
          thou the desire didst hear;
     Thou wilt prepare their heart, and thou
          to hear wilt bend thine ear;

18   To judge the fatherless, and those
          that are oppressed sore;
     That man, that is but sprung of earth,
          may them oppress no more.
