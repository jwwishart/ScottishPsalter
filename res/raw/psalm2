1    Why rage the heathen? and vain things
          why do the people mind?
2    Kings of the earth do set themselves,
          and princes are combin'd,

     To plot against the Lord, and his
          Anointed, saying thus,
3    Let us asunder break their bands,
          and cast their cords from us.

4    He that in heaven sits shall laugh;
          the Lord shall scorn them all.
5    Then shall he speak to them in wrath,
          in rage he vex them shall.

6    Yet, notwithstanding, I have him
          to be my King appointed;
     And over Sion, my holy hill,
          I have him King anointed.

7    The sure decree I will declare:
          The Lord hath said to me,
     Thou art mine only Son; this day
          I have begotten thee.

8    Ask of me, and for heritage
          the heathen I'll make thine;
     And, for possession, I to thee
          will give earth's utmost line.

9    Thou shalt, as with a weighty rod
          of iron, break them all;
     And, as a potter's sherd, thou shalt
          them dash in pieces small.

10   Now therefore, kings, be wise; be taught,
          ye judges of the earth:
11   Serve God in fear, and see that ye
          join trembling with your mirth.

12   Kiss ye the Son, lest in his ire
          ye perish from the way,
     If once his wrath begin to burn:
          bless'd all that on him stay.
