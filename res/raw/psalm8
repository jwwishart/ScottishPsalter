1    How excellent in all the earth,
          Lord, our Lord, is thy name!
     Who hast thy glory far advanc'd
          above the starry frame.

2    From infants' and from sucklings' mouth
          thou didest strength ordain,
     For thy foes' cause, that so thou might'st
          th' avenging foe restrain.

3    When I look up unto the heav'ns,
          which thine own fingers fram'd,
     Unto the moon, and to the stars,
          which were by thee ordain'd;

4    Then say I, What is man, that he
          remember'd is by thee?
     Or what the son of man, that thou
          so kind to him should'st be?

5    For thou a little lower hast
          him than the angels made;
     With glory and with dignity
          thou crowned hast his head.

6    Of thy hands' works thou mad'st him lord,
          all under's feet didst lay;
7    All sheep and oxen, yea, and beasts
          that in the field do stray;

8    Fowls of the air, fish of the sea,
          all that pass through the same.
9    How excellent in all the earth,
          Lord, our Lord, is thy name!
